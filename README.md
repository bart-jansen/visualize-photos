# Visualize photos
Analyze your own photos in the cloud/on your PC, upload their metadata to Azure DocumentDB and view their metadata. This contains the default metadata (e.g. GPS/Compass direction), but also allows you to leverage Microsoft Cognitive Services to get further insights (e.g. Vision/Emotion and different Faces)

## Installation
- Add all required env vars in your application as follows:
```
VISION_KEY=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX--XX--XXX
FACE_KEY=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX--XX--XXX
EMOTION_KEY=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX--XX--XXX
DOBDB_ENDPOINT=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX--XX--XXX
DOCDB_KEY=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX--XX--XXX
```
